# Desktop Enviornment

My desktop enviornment is currently a work in progress, I work on it every now and then, so don't be too quick to judge.

## Architecture

The desktop enviornment I have made relies on a few components in order to work seamlessly:

1. Windowing System: X11
2. Display Manger: LightDM
3. Desktop Enviornment: AwesomeWM
4. Compositor: picom

Most of the configurations for these can be found in other areas of the repository.
