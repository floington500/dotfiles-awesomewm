# Desktop Enviornment

My desktop enviornment is a masterpiece that should be compared to the likes of the greatest artists that have marveled history.

## Architecture

The underlying system relies on a few magnificantly implemented subsystems in order to run seamlessly:

1. Display Manger: LightDM
1. Windowing System: X11
3. Window Manager: AwesomeWM
4. Compositor: picom

The configuration for these can be found under my other repository for configurations.
